## Activity 2 : Browser Back Button :

Ever imagined how the browser back button gives us exactly the previously visited page. Well that is thanks to **stack** data structure.
Stacks work on the **Last In First Out** principle.
In a stack, the last element added can be accessed using **pop()** method. Using **push()** method, a new element is added to the stack. To acces the element at the top of the stack, we use the **peek()** method.

On the other hand, we have queues where the operations on data can be performed on both the ends. They work on the **First IN First Out** principle. To add data to the queue, we use **enqueue()** method. The element is added at the end i.e. behind the last added element. To remove an element from a queue, we use **dequeue()** method which gives the first element of the queue. On using **peek()** method, we cann access the first element without removing it.

Q : What is the difference in peek() method in queue and stack?
