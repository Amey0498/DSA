# Introduction

A **data structure** is a named location that can be used to store and organise **data**. And, an **algorithm** is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning **data structures and algorithms** allow us to write efficient and optimised computer programs.

### Background

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **data structure** is a data organisation, management, and storage format that enables [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency) access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of [data values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **algorithm** is a finite sequence of [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined), computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always [unambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous) and are used as specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation), [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing), [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), and other tasks.
