# Introduction

A **data structure** is a named location that can be used to store and organise **data**. And, an **algorithm** is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning **data structures and algorithms** allow us to write efficient and optimised computer programs.

### Background

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **data structure** is a data organisation, management, and storage format that enables [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency) access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of [data values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **algorithm** is a finite sequence of [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined), computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always [unambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous) and are used as specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation), [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing), [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), and other tasks.

#### Activity 1 : Starting with our Grocery (Lists, LLs, DLLs, CLLs): 

#### Activity 2 : Browser Back Button :

Ever imagined how the browser back button gives us exactly the previously visited page. Well that is thanks to **stack** data structure.
Stacks work on the **Last In First Out** principle.
In a stack, the last element added can be accessed using **pop()** method. Using **push()** method, a new element is added to the stack. To acces the element at the top of the stack, we use the **peek()** method.

On the other hand, we have queues where the operations on data can be performed on both the ends. They work on the **First IN First Out** principle. To add data to the queue, we use **enqueue()** method. The element is added at the end i.e. behind the last added element. To remove an element from a queue, we use **dequeue()** method which gives the first element of the queue. On using **peek()** method, we cann access the first element without removing it.

Q : What is the difference in peek() method in queue and stack?
